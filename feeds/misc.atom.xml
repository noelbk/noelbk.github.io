&lt;p&gt;[...] one of three vegetative patients to correctly answer questions
such as, “Are you in a hospital?” and “Is your name Mike?” posed
using a new, more effective technique of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). His responses are a leap forward in communications with
unresponsive patients, building on a breakthrough contact that
researchers achieved with him in 2012 using a more primitive
technique.&lt;/p&gt;

Nov. 13, 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because each of those thoughts activated different parts of the
brain, British neuroscientist Adrian Owen, who led the team, says
Routley was able to communicate clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hospital patient deemed vegetative is now able to make a “thumbs
up” gesture – a sign to family that he is aware, but not yet strong
enough to persuade doctors to drop a recommendation to withdraw life
support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leading neuroscientist, Adrian Owen, travelled to Mr. Rasouli’s
bedside at Sunnybrook on Tuesday, to conduct investigations to
determine whether he can communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His investigations come on the heels of a study he published in the
medical journal The Lancet, revealing that 19 per cent of patients
believed to be in an irreversible vegetative state showed signs of
full consciousness when tested with an electroencephalography
machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory approval requires a deeper understanding of the network
than just black boxes, and there is new mathementics being developed
to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep learning architectures have recently reemerged with the advent
of new computational resources and algorithmic improvements. They
are yielding remarkable state of the art results in numerous
learning tasks, primarily in computer vision for the analysis of
images, speech recognition, and natural language processing [...]
However, the complexity of such algorithms means that they have
remained essentially a black box, yielding proportionally little
insight given their performance achievements, which limits their
utility in fields outside of those traditionally tackled by the
machine learning community and obstructs new scientific
directions. My research aims to open this blackbox by utilizing
tools from harmonic analysis to construct multiscale deep learning
architectures amenable to mathematical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, devices based on neural networks have recently
been granted FDA approval, and there are many startups emerging in
this space.&lt;/p&gt;
